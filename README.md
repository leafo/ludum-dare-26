# Moondar
### A game made in 48 hours for Ludum Dare 26

Life seemed so normal driving around your moon buggy on planet Moondar, until
one day aliens invaded. You narrowly escaped their mothership but
your moon buggy was damaged and is now out of control.

Travel across Moondar on your runaway moon buggy, narrowly avoiding obstacles
while shooting aliens who try to attack you from above. Are you good enough to
make it across Moondar? (Hint: you aren't, the game lasts forever.)

### Controls

* W A S D - Move
* Mouse - Aim and shoot
* Space - Jump

### How to play

You buggy can be in one of three rows at any given time. The on screen
indicator on the top left will tell which one you are in. As the buggy moves
obstacles will take up an entire row for a brief period of time. Move the buggy
out of the way to avoid collision. Hitting an obstacle will take 1/3 of your
health.

In order to control the buggy stand inside one of the control platforms on
either the left or right and then move your player either up or down against
the buggy.

Watch for the flashing lights in the indicator to see when obstacles are
approaching.

While you are driving, enemies will attack you from above. Shoot them to clear
them out while grabbing extra points.
